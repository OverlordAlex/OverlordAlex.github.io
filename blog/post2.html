                        <h1>On learning HTML and CSS</h1>
                        <time>Wednesday, 8 May 2019</time>
                    </section>
                    <section>
                        <p>If you haven't noticed yet, this site is entirely built using only HTML5 and CSS<sup><a href="#citation[1]">[1]</a></sup>. I'm rather proud of this - the pages are blazing fast to load and only take around 25kb</p>
                        <p>If we break it down further this is 2kb for the CSS, 17kb for that adorable profile picture, and then the rest is content<sup><a href="#citation[2]">[2]</a></sup>. Not too shabby!</p>
                        <p>As part of developing this there were some cool bits that I stumbled across - most of this should be familiar to anyone who's touched web code in the last 5 years but were new to me!
                    </section>
                    <section>
                        <p>I'm a backend developer through and through - at university<sup><a href="#citation[3]">[3]</a></sup> we didn't even look at an HTML tag, nevermind something as revolutionary as jQuery!<sup><a href="#citation[4]">[4]</a></sup></p>
                        <p>This means that all my exposure was through piece-meal picking at websites when they weren't working quite right, or one of the numerous times I tried to start a personal site and ended up with yet another shitty, bloated, unintelligible wordpress theme - no offence, I just hated not understanding what was going on and not being able to meaningfully change it.</p>
                        <p>Finally, thanks to GitHub Pages and some spare energy I worked up the impetus to get my shit together.</p>
                    </section>

                    <section>
                        <h2>CSS Grid</h2>
                        <p>Probably the coolest thing I learnt was about CSS grid - it made incredibly intuitive sense! Simply define the grid, name the areas, and voil√†! Responsive web design!</p>
                        <p>There are many, many blogs extolling the virtues of grid<sup><a href="#citation[5]">[5]</a></sup> and explaining how to use it, but honestly it was so straightforward I couldn't believe it!</p>
                    </section>

                    <section>
                        <h2>Semantic HTML</h2>
                        <p>For a long time I held the belief that HTML was a soup of random tags pulled from a hat, and while that's still largely true I like the direction and push to use semantic tags - at the very least I feel better writing it.</p>
                    </section>

                    <section>
                        <h2>Bash + Sed</h2>
                        <p>It's kinda odd, however I take a rather perverse pleasure in writing bash. Every inscrutable line, all the pipes, the arrays - they all make me feel a little bit like a maverick, a rebel, a rule-breaker. But honestly, who wouldn't want that?<sup><a href="#citation[6]">[6]</a></sup></p>
                        <p>It was far too tempting to re-invent the wheel and write some bash for this site, and since it is based around interpolation of course I had to dig out old memories of using sed. After some liberal application of Stack Overflow I eventually got to this line, which is awful</p>
                        <code>
                            sed -e "/##$filename##/  {" -e "r $f" -e "d" -e "}" -i {} \;
                        </code>
                        <p>What the hell is going on with all those options anyways??</p>
