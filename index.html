                        <p>We've all heard about them - junior, senior, IC1, SWE3, etc. But what do they really mean?<sup><a id="citationbackref[1]" href="#citation[1]">[1]</a></sup></p>
                    </section>
                    <section>
                        <h2>IC1 / Junior</h2>
                        <p>A rock.</p>
                        <p>No, seriously. You can give them some tasks to hold down and they'll do a marvelous job, but anything large is beyond them. Without constant tending and supervision they'll be a rock forever.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand they're everywhere and they're cheap.</p>
                    </section>
                    <section>
                        <h2>IC2 / Junior <em>Developer</em></h2>
                        <p>Just as the first land-animals crawled out of the primordial ooze so too were IC2s left behind to wallow in filth.</p>
                        <p>Able to think independently (more-or-less) these developers can be farmed in great numbers using simple cubicles and strategically placed coffee machines.</p>
                        <p>Not to be confused with Code Monkeys, these developers are still satisfied being paid in peanuts.</p>
                    </section>
                    <section>
                        <h2>IC3 / Software Developer</h2>
                        <q>Ooh-bi-doo, Can learn to be like you, too</q><sup><a id="citationbackref[2]" href="#citation[2]">[2]</a></sup>
                        <p>Easily identified by their hoodies and dual monitors, mentioning anything trivial such as programming languages or IDEs in their presence will lead to much excitement and excrement flinging.</p>
                        <p>With dreams of moving upwards and a disdain for those below some of these developers can easily become poisonous and should be carefully avoided.</p>

                    <section>
                        <h2>IC4 / <em>Senior</em> Software Developer</h2>
                        <p>Think they're better than everyone else - and why not? They literally know everything! They've seen it all - all the patterns, all the mistakes, all the war stories.</p>
                        <p>Woe be the IC3 that dares question a design drawn up by a <em>senior</em>.</p>
                        <p>Shadowed by gigantic salaries and a love of documentation these engineers are generally the powerhouse of the <s>cell</s> organisation.</p>

                    <section>
                        <h2>IC5 / Architect</h2>
                        <p>Demands an office simply as a status symbol as they're typically only ever glimpsed stalking the hallways between meetings.</p>
                        <p>Mythic figures who divine the tablets passed from the C-levels and translate them into projects to be implemented by the seniors.</p>
                        <p>Summoned by the sound of calendar invites they're likely to have an unread inbox greater than five digits.</p>
